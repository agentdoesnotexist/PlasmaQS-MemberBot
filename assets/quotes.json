Wild and I knew from the very start of taking back QS that we had to draw a line that could not be recrossed: accomplices to the occupation cannot be unbanned. You may have not participated in the occupation as much as some of the other accomplices and/or conspirators, but you still participated nonetheless and that cannot be forgiven. I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a good day.",

I've moved on from QSTF the day I left it to join QAC. QSTF is no longer a thing, so I suggest you to move on as well.\n\nIf would like to appeal your ban do so in QOC- oh wait you did appeal for it and then deleted it and left..? Well not my issue anymore!\nI don't care if you have my face or my name, they are no secret, and you using it to make feel scared shows your level as a person. I am ashamed for your \"friends\" being your \"friends\", probably because you are going to pull something like this to them.",
