## bot

The Plasma-QS Member Tracker is a bot programmed in JS using the discord.js library. This was, and still is a joke project, and contributes nothing to society at all.

## requirements

- Node 12x
- Time to waste

## how to run

Open the `configTemplate.json` file and fill in the values, **then rename it to `config.json`.**

```json
{
    "bot": {
        "devmode": "(Boolean) Enable development mode [true/false]",
        "prefix": "(String) Prefix for commands",
        "managers": [
          "(String/Array) User IDs for users who can run all commands"
        ],
        "token": "(String) Bot Token"
    },
    "channels": {
        "counting": "(String) Channel ID where group stats are displayed",
        "starboard": "(String) Channel ID where starred messages are sent",
        "welcome": "(String) Channel ID where welcome messages are sent"
    },
    "other": {
        "adminRole": "(String) Admin role ID to run higher commands",
        "enforceWhitelist": "(Boolean) Enforce extra join security"
    }
}
```

To install the required libraries, run (in the direrctory of the bot):

```
npm i
```

Once you're done, run `node index.js` and (assumming you've made changes to the code to prevent the bot from having a moment) the bot will go live!
