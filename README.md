## bot

The Plasma-QS Member Tracker is a bot programmed in JS using the discord.js library. This was, and still is a joke project, and contributes nothing to society at all.

## requirements

- Node 12x
- Time to waste

## how to run

Open the `configTemplate.json` file and fill in the values, **then rename it to `config.json`.**

```json
{
  "token": "Token of the bot that will be used",
  "prefix": "Prefix for commands",
  "welcomeChannel": "Channel where welcome messages are displayed",
  "starboardChannel": "Channel where the starboard (pinned messages) are displayed",
  "adminRole": "Role where admins get access to admin commands",
  "managers": ["[ARRAY - STRING] Users who will have access to developer commands"],
  "enhancedSecurity": "[BOOLEAN - TRUE/FALSE] Indicates whether strict security measures will be enforced"
}
```

To install the required libraries, run (in the direrctory of the bot):

```bash
npm i
```

Once you're done, run `node index.js` and (assumming you've made changes to the code to prevent the bot from having a moment) the bot will go live!
