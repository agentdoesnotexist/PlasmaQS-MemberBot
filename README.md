## bot

The Plasma-QS Member Tracker is a bot programmed in JS using the discord.js library. This was, and still is a joke project, and contributes nothing to society at all.

## requirements

- Node 12x
- Time to waste

## how to run

Create a `config.json` file with this inside:

```json
{
  "token": "BOT TOKEN",
  "prefix": "ANY PREFIX",
  "version": "this really doesn't matter"
}
```

To install the required libraries, run (in the direrctory of the bot):

```bash
npm i
```

Once you're done, run `node index.js` and (assumming you've made changes to the code to prevent the bot from having a moment) the bot will go live!
